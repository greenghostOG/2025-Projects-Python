Basic Python Chat Room

Usage :-

nc <server_ip_address> 5050
use nc 0.0.0.0 5050

This project demonstrates a fundamental chat application built in Python. It features a multi-threaded server capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously, allowing for basic text-based communication.

Key Features:-
1. Server-Client Architecture: Implemented a simple server that listens for incoming connections and manages data exchange with connected clients.

2. Multi-threading for Concurrency: Utilized Python's threading module to ensure the server can efficiently handle multiple clients without blocking, providing a smooth chat experience for all participants.

3. Basic Data Exchange: Facilitates sending and receiving text messages between the server and connected clients.

4. Netcat (nc) Compatibility: Clients can easily connect to the server using the netcat utility via a basic command

What I Learned:-
Developing this project provided hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of:

1. Socket Programming: The core concepts of creating, binding, listening, and accepting network sockets for communication.

2. Server-Side and Client-Side Handling: Differentiating and implementing the logic required for both server operations (managing connections, receiving/sending data) and client interaction.

3. Concurrency with Threads: How to leverage threading to build responsive network applications that can serve multiple users concurrently.
